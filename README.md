# Project Overview
This project implements Resnet34 which is trained on over a million images and utilizes transfer learning for training the model which correctly identifies the Straw Hat Pirates

# Key Features
-> 75% accuracy on validation set
-> Transfer Learning with Resnet34
-> Deployed on Huggingface Spaces for public access

# Tech Stack
== Deep Learning - FastAI, Pytorch
== Data Collection - iCrawler (Google Search Images)
== Web Interface - Gradio
== Deployment - Huggingface Spaces
== Development - Visual Studio Code

# What I Learned?
